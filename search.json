    "text": "Task Breakdown:\nHaley- researched and identified the data set used\nLauren- found and researched the reference code used\nSami- developed the code to create the visuals\nDiana - created the synergy report\nAbout the data:\nThe data set used aimed to observe the net domestic immigration rates (NDIR), which represents the net movement of people into and out of a state, over the period 1990-1994 divided by the population of the state. Alaska and Hawaii are excluded from the analysis because the environments of these states are significantly different from the other 48, and their locations present certain barriers to immigration. Eleven predictor variables thought to influence NDIR are defined in Table 1.4.\n\nGenerated charts:\nThe first and second tax bracket shows a higher number of people immigrating in this tax bracket than emigrating. However, the third and fourth tax brackets have lower immigration rates than emigration rates. This shows there is no general trend of NDIR in relation to all four tax brackets.\nWhat can be observed is that the lower the value of NDIR, the more people are emigrating out of the state, the higher the value of NDIR, the more people are immigrating into the state.\nThe immigration/emigration graph organized by region, suggests that people in the Northeast region almost exclusively emigrate. The effects of region on tax bracket model shows that none of the participants responded that they belonged in either of the first two tax brackets. This could also be the reason that we do not see Northeast noticeably represented in the aggregated model.\nIndependent Variable (IV): Regional Tax Brackets\nDependent Variable (DV): NDIR (Net Domestic Immigration Rate)\npeople immigrating- “1”\nemigrating - “0”\n\n# Setting up the new R environment, starting fresh, click run!\n\nrm(list=ls())\n\n# Setting up the working directory, click run!\n\nsetwd(\"~/Desktop\")\n\n# Reading the file, click run!\n\nHW4 <- read.delim(\"HW4data.txt\")\n\nhead(HW4)\n\n        State   NDIR Unemp  Wage Crime Income Metrop Poor Taxes Educ BusFail\n1     Alabama  17.47   6.0 10.75   780  27196   67.4 16.4  1553 66.9    0.20\n2     Arizona  49.60   6.4 11.17   715  31293   84.7 15.9  2122 78.7    0.51\n3    Arkansas  23.62   5.3  9.65   593  25565   44.7 15.3  1590 66.3    0.08\n4  California -37.21   8.6 12.44  1078  35331   96.7 17.9  2396 76.2    0.63\n5    Colorado  53.17   4.2 12.27   567  37833   81.8  9.0  2092 84.4    0.42\n6 Connecticut -38.41   5.6 13.53   456  41097   95.7 10.8  3334 79.2    0.33\n   Temp    Region\n1 62.77     South\n2 61.09      West\n3 59.57     South\n4 59.25      West\n5 43.43      West\n6 48.63 Northeast\n\n\n\n# Turning on the packages required for HW4, click run!\n\nlibrary(\"Hmisc\")\n\nLoading required package: lattice\n\n\nLoading required package: survival\n\n\nLoading required package: Formula\n\n\nLoading required package: ggplot2\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'Hmisc'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    format.pval, units\n\n\n\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.0      ✔ stringr 1.4.1 \n✔ readr   2.1.2      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n✔ purrr   0.3.4      \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter()    masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()       masks stats::lag()\n✖ dplyr::src()       masks Hmisc::src()\n✖ dplyr::summarize() masks Hmisc::summarize()\n\n\n\n# Identifying the mean of HW4 for later usage: mean= 10.88854, click run!\n\nmean(HW4$NDIR)\n\n[1] 10.88854\n\n\n\n# Creating a new dummy variable, i.e. above 1 or below 0 mean, click run!\n\nHW4$NDIR_dummy <- ifelse(HW4$NDIR>=10.88854, 1, 0)\n\n# Creating taxes into an ordinal variable with 4 equally sized bins, click run!\n\nHW4$tax_ord <- cut2(HW4$Taxes, m=12)\n\n# Creating cross tabulation, click run!\n\ntable(HW4$NDIR_dummy,HW4$tax_ord)\n\n   \n    [1535,1853) [1853,2126) [2126,2371) [2371,3655]\n  0           5           4           7          10\n  1           7           8           5           2\n\n\n\n# Creating bar plot, click run!\n\nbarplot(table(HW4$NDIR_dummy,HW4$tax_ord), beside=TRUE, main= \"The Effect of Tax Brackets on NDIR\", xlab= \"Tax Brackets\", ylab= \"NDIR\", legend = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nbarplot(table(HW4$NDIR_dummy,HW4$Region), beside=TRUE, main= \"The Effect of Region on NDIR\", xlab= \"Region\", ylab= \"NDIR\", legend = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nbarplot(table(HW4$tax_ord,HW4$Region), beside=TRUE, main= \"The Effect of Region on Tax Brackets\", xlab= \"Region\", ylab= \"Tax Bracket Prevalence\", legend = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n# Code for a Table with Embedded Charts\n\n# ggplot(df,aes(z,x,fill=as.factor(y)),angle=45,size=16)+ geom_bar(position=\"dodge\",stat=\"identity\") +facet_wrap(~z,nrow=3)\n\n# Creating Table with Embedded Charts, click run! \n\ndf <- data.frame(HW4)\n\np <- ggplot(df,aes(tax_ord,NDIR,fill=as.factor(Region)),angle=45,size=5)+ \n\n  geom_bar(position=\"dodge\",stat=\"identity\") +facet_wrap(~tax_ord,nrow=3)\n\np + ggtitle(\"The Effect of Tax Brackets on NDIR by Region\") + xlab(\"Tax Brackets\") + ylab(\"NDIR\") + guides(fill=guide_legend(title=\"Region\")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6))"

The lines for the lost or died and released outcomes of shelter animals are so faint that they could be easily missed or confused for another outcome. Their labels fail to clearly point out which line they are referring to. The faint outcome lines make it difficult to differentiate between the negative outcomes in blue and more positive outcomes in orange. I think this graph pays too much attention to the steady decline of euthanasia rates that it takes focus away from the positive outcomes. I would argue that this graph could have depicted its data better by getting rid of the orange and blue color blocks and highligting each outcome variable with a clearly marked and color coded line."
