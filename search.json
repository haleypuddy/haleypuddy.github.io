Changing the pch alters the points of the plotline to different shapes like solid or empty circles or even squares.\npoints(x, y1, pch=16, cex=2) # Try different cex value?\nCex changes the size of the plots on the plotline. A larger cex value will produce larger points on the plot line.\naxis(1, at=seq(0, 16, 4)) # What is the first number standing for?\nThis function is used to add an axis to a chart. The 1 indicates side = 1, which is the x axis. Side = 2 would be the y axis.The at parameter specifies the position of the labels and the seq refers to the sequence function. This seq function says we want a label on the x axis every 4 increments starting at 0 and ending at 16.\n\nHere are the graphs from murrell01.R:\n\n\n\nMurrell Graphs\n\n\nHere is an example of a boxplot graph using the Happy Planet Data Set:"

The lines for the lost or died and released outcomes of shelter animals are so faint that they could be easily missed or confused for another outcome. Their labels fail to clearly point out which line they are referring to. The faint outcome lines make it difficult to differentiate between the negative outcomes in blue and more positive outcomes in orange. I think this graph pays too much attention to the steady decline of euthanasia rates that it takes focus away from the positive outcomes. I would argue that this graph could have depicted its data better by getting rid of the orange and blue color blocks and highligting each outcome variable with a clearly marked and color coded line."
